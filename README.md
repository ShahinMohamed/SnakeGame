# SnakeGame
I created the classic snake game which runs on the windows console using c++.

There are 5 main functions.
* setup() for intial position of snake and setting score as zero
* draw() to make the snake move and fruits appear at random
* input() to get the character when the user hits the keyboard
* logic() to whether head touches the body or the fruit and also to update the score
* main() where the game loop runs.
